# 176. Second Highest Salary
## Answer
```mysql
WITH salary_rank AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS 'num'
    FROM Employee
),
salary_total AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary) AS 'num' FROM Employee
)
SELECT
    IF(salary_total.num = 1,NULL,salary_rank.salary) AS 'SecondHighestSalary'
FROM salary_rank, salary_total
WHERE 
    salary_rank.num = 2 OR salary_total.num = 1
LIMIT 1

-- 其他人的解法, 原來這樣就可以印出null了
-- 我寫這麼一大串都是為了那個null XD
SELECT(
    SELECT DISTINCT Salary 
    FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC 
    LIMIT 1 offset 1
) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```

## Question
```
Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```
