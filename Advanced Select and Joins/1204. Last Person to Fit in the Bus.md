# 1204. Last Person to Fit in the Bus
## Answer
```mysql
SELECT
    person_name
FROM (
    SELECT 
        *, 
        SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn) AS 'total_weight' 
    FROM Queue
    ) t
WHERE total_weight <= 1000
ORDER BY total_weight DESC LIMIT 1

-- 語法筆記: SUM(c1) OVER (ORDER BY c2)
-- 依照c2的順序對c1的數值進行累計加總 (依照邏輯應該AVG()之類的其他函式也可以使用)
-- ORDER BY column_name [DESC] LIMIT 1  
-- 找到最小[最大]的那 1 筆資料

-- 另外看到其他人用JOIN的解法, 覺得很有趣也記錄下來
-- 思路解析: 例用JOIN限定q2的範圍算出重量總和, 接著篩選出總和在1000以下且最大的那一筆數據
SELECT 
    q1.person_name
FROM Queue q1 
JOIN Queue q2 ON q1.turn >= q2.turn
GROUP BY q1.turn
HAVING SUM(q2.weight) <= 1000
ORDER BY SUM(q2.weight) DESC
LIMIT 1
```

## Question
```
Table: Queue

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |
+-------------+---------+
person_id column contains unique values.
This table has the information about all people waiting for a bus.
The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.
turn determines the order of which the people will board the bus, where turn=1 denotes the first person to board and turn=n denotes the last person to board.
weight is the weight of the person in kilograms.
 

There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.

Write a solution to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Queue table:
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
| person_id | person_name | weight | turn |
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
| 5         | Alice       | 250    | 1    |
| 4         | Bob         | 175    | 5    |
| 3         | Alex        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | John Cena   | 400    | 3    |
| 1         | Winston     | 500    | 6    |
| 2         | Marie       | 200    | 4    |
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| person_name |
+-------------+
| John Cena   |
+-------------+
Explanation: The folowing table is ordered by the turn for simplicity.
+------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
| Turn | ID | Name      | Weight | Total Weight |
+------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
| 1    | 5  | Alice     | 250    | 250          |
| 2    | 3  | Alex      | 350    | 600          |
| 3    | 6  | John Cena | 400    | 1000         | (last person to board)
| 4    | 2  | Marie     | 200    | 1200         | (cannot board)
| 5    | 4  | Bob       | 175    | ___          |
| 6    | 1  | Winston   | 500    | ___          |
+------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
```
