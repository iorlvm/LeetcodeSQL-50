# 602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends
## Answer
```mysql
SELECT
    i.id,
    IFNULL(a.accepter_count,0) + IFNULL(r.requester_count,0) AS 'num'
FROM (
    SELECT requester_id AS 'id' FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION 
    SELECT accepter_id AS 'id' FROM RequestAccepted
) i
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT
        IFNULL(r1.requester_id,r2.accepter_id) AS 'id',
        COUNT(r2.accepter_id) AS 'accepter_count'
    FROM 
        (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id FROM RequestAccepted) r1
    RIGHT JOIN RequestAccepted r2 ON
        r1.requester_id = r2.accepter_id
    GROUP BY id
) a ON a.id = i.id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT
        r1.requester_id AS 'id',
        COUNT(r1.requester_id) AS 'requester_count'
    FROM RequestAccepted r1
    GROUP BY r1.requester_id
) r ON r.id = i.id
ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 1

-- 思路: 
-- 先用UNION取得全部出現過的id
-- 分別取得每一個id的accepter次數跟requester的次數
-- 最後將其加總放到對應的位置 取出數量最高的那一筆資料
-- 原本還擔心會不會有同樣好友數量的情形  要是有的話還需要打補丁 (結果沒有)

## Question
```
Table: RequestAccepted

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
 

Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
Explanation: 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
 

Follow up: In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?
