# 626. Exchange Seats
## Answer
```mysql
SELECT
    (id+1) AS 'id',student
FROM Seat
WHERE (id+1) IN (SELECT id FROM Seat) AND id%2=1
UNION
SELECT 
    id,student
FROM Seat
WHERE (id+1) NOT IN (SELECT id FROM Seat) AND id%2=1
UNION
SELECT
    id-1 AS 'id',student
FROM Seat
WHERE id%2=0
ORDER BY id;
-- 解法思路: 
-- 找到最大的奇數id 並且判斷是否存在下一個偶數id
-- 如果存在就id+1 不存在就不做更動, 再找到所有的偶數id 並且id-1
-- 最後將三個結果連結起來做id排序


-- 看到其他人的解法用CASE WHEN, 我傻了怎麼沒想到
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) AND id%2=1
            THEN id
        WHEN id%2=1
            THEN id+1
        ELSE
            id-1
    END AS 'id',
    student
FROM
    Seat
ORDER BY id;
```

## Question
```
Table: Seat

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
id is a continuous increment.
 

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Explanation: 
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.
```
